## Project Overview

The dataset consists of sales records from multiple CSV files (one per month). The goal is to merge these datasets, clean the data, and analyze sales patterns to help the business understand:

- Which month had the highest sales revenue?
- Which city had the most sales?
- What are the best times to target customers with advertisements?
- Which products are most frequently sold together?
- What is the best-selling product and how does its price relate to sales quantity?

## Insights and Findings

- December had the highest sales revenue.
- San Francisco (CA) topped city sales.
- Recommended advertisement times are slightly before 11 AM and 7 PM, based on purchase patterns.
- Certain product pairs, like "iPhone" and "Lightning Charging Cable," are frequently sold together.
- The most sold product is AAA Batteries (4-pack), which is low priced, suggesting price sensitivity in sales volume.
